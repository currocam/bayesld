	abstract = {Individuals sharing recent ancestors are likely to co-inherit large identical-by-descent ({IBD}) genomic regions. The distribution of these {IBD} segments in a population may be used to reconstruct past demographic events such as effective population size variation, but accurate {IBD} detection is difficult in ancient {DNA} data and in underrepresented populations with limited reference data. In this work, we introduce an accurate method for inferring effective population size variation during the past {\textasciitilde}2000 years in both modern and ancient {DNA} data, called {HapNe}. {HapNe} infers recent population size fluctuations using either {IBD} sharing ({HapNe}-{IBD}) or linkage disequilibrium ({HapNe}-{LD}), which does not require phasing and can be computed in low coverage data, including data sets with heterogeneous sampling times. {HapNe} shows improved accuracy in a range of simulated demographic scenarios compared to currently available methods for {IBD}-based and {LD}-based inference of recent effective population size, while requiring fewer computational resources. We apply {HapNe} to several modern populations from the 1,000 Genomes Project, the {UK} Biobank, the Allen Ancient {DNA} Resource, and recently published samples from Iron Age Britain, detecting multiple instances of recent effective population size variation across these groups.},
