## Main point
Conservation biologists could benefit from using model-based inference to infer recent effective changes in Ne by considering realistic models and incorporating prior information. 

## Story

1. LD patterns are highly informative to study recent Ne and we propose efficient technical interface to use it.
2. We exemplify how to use it in 2, 3 different scenarios

## What did you do?

1. Expand theory from HapNe
2. Develop very efficient numerical tools and autograd to compute likelihoods
3. Evaluate the impact of regularization and finding ours work better for invasion.
4. Secondary introductions using SBI (TODO)

## Why did you do what you did?

1. To have a invasion-like scenario
2. To effectively fitting this sort of models
3. To show that having realistic models improve the inference
4. To account for more complex models

## What were the results of what you did?
